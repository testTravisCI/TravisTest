# Codesling Realtime Socket Server Developer Documentation

**Note:** If you want to run all backend services along with the clientside development server, check out the main `README.md` [instructions](README.md#getting-started)

To begin developing on the realtime websocket server, run the following from the `socket-server` folder:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

# API

## Client Events:

* [client.ready](#clientready)
* [client.update](#clientupdate)
* [client.disconnect](#clientdisconnect)
* [client.message](#clientmessage)

#### client.ready

Emit to the server when component has loaded and is ready to receive updates. 
Sends challenge data for both clients to access.

```plaintext
payload: {
  challenge: OBJECT
}
```

#### client.update

Emit to the server when user has changed the state of the code editor

```plaintext
payload: {
  text: STRING,
  email: STRING
}
```

#### client.run

Emit to the server when a user wants to run the code in the code editor

```plaintext
payload: {

```

#### client.disconnect

Emit to the server when the code editor component unmounts (user navigates away from the editor page)

```plaintext
payload: {}

## Server Events:

* [server.initialState](#serverinitialstate)
* [server.changed](#serverchanged)
* [server.leave](#serverleave)
* [server.message](#serverMessage)

#### server.initialState

Emitted initially (once) by the server after client has verified that it is ready to begin rendering code editor text updates

```plaintext
payload: {
  text: STRING
